## Components

The component was removed.

### `<Card.CollapsedHeader/>`, `<Card.ButtonHeader/>`, `<Card.LinkHeader/>`

These deprecated component were completely removed in Version 6. You should use the `<Card.Header/>`
and the `<Collapse/>` components instead.

Refer to the [Card
story](https://wix-wix-style-react.surge.sh/?selectedKind=2.%20Layout&selectedStory=Card&full=0&addons=0&stories=1&panelRight=0) for example usages.

#### For `<Card.CollapsedHeader/>`

Use the `<Collapse/>` component in combination with the `<Card.Content/>` component, like in the
following order:

```jsx
<Card>
  <Collapse>
    <Card.Content />
  </Collapse>
</Card>
```

#### For `<Card.ButtonHeader/>`

Use the `<Card.Header suffix={<Button/>} />` instead.

#### For `<Card.LinkHeader/>`

### `<Tag/>`

The component's margins has been updated according to the correct UX guidelines. The `useOldMargins`
prop has been removed and the new margins were applied by default.

like so:

- `<Text bold="false">` -> `<Heading weight="thin">`
- `<Text bold="true">` -> `<Heading weight="normal">`

In addition, the testkit method `isBold()` has been removed and should be now used as `getWeight()
=== 'normal'`.

### Importing from `Table/Toolbar`

| `pressUpKey()` | `keyDown('ArrowUp')` |
| `pressAnyKey()` | `keyDown('Any')` |
| `pressEnterKey()` | `keyDown('Enter')` |
| `pressSpaceKey()` | `keyDown(' ')` |

## Misc

### Typography.scss

`<Heading/>` and `<Text/>` components or the [new typography
classes](../../stories/Typography/TypographyClassesMigration.md) instead of these classes when
possible.

### Polyfills

The deprecated testkits' polyfills were removed in Version 6. You should use the newer polyfills
located in `testkit/polyfills`.

| Old polyfill import | New polyfill import |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------- |
| `import polyfill from 'wix-style-react/Backoffice/Tooltip/CancelAnimationPolyfill.js'` | `import { requestAnimationFramePolyfill } from 'wix-style-react/testkit/polyfills'` |
| `import applyPolyfills from 'wix-style-react/DatePicker/Polyfills.js'` | `import { requestAnimationFramePolyfill } from 'wix-style-react/testkit/polyfills'` |
| `import polyfill from 'wix-style-react/utils/RangePolyfill.js'` | `import { rangePolyfill } from 'wix-style-react/testkit/polyfills'` |

The polyfills' usage has also been changed. While the old polyfills were installed when `import`ed,
the newer polyfills require you to install then manually, allowing better isolation. For example:

```js
import { rangePolyfill } from 'wix-style-react/testkit/polyfills';

beforeEach(() => {
  rangePolyfill.install();
});

afterEach(() => {
  rangePolyfill.uninstall();
});

// ...
```
